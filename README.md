# Simple MVC blog in clean php

The main goal was to create an OOP architecture using clean php.

It's very simple app. There are some empty pages, and page with posts. 
There is control of user permissions. 
Admin can create,update,delete posts.
Every user can look at posts.

P.S this architecture can be even call something like little framework :), because i did it that way that you can create record in database using model name and function create(like it is in Laravel).
For example Post::create($data) will create record with $data array in `posts` table

This app of course can be improved :)
